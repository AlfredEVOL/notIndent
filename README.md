I had an inspiration, a call from above.

The world needs negative indentation, and I have to make it.

So, here I present to you [NotIndent](https://alfredjophy.ml/notIndent). (plz dont ask me why)


*P.S i made this in a few hours...my react skills are not that great, my CSS skills are evident, would love some PRs*

## Algorithm

1. Format with prettier (using spaces ofcourse,XD)
2. Find the deepest indentation level - *O(n)*  (will be fun with long files)
3. Change indentation level of each line to i_deep - i
4. Voila
